# pwatson
A faster alternative to basic watson operations

## Setup
Have perl 5 on your laptop
```
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## Execution
For now pwatson isn't installed in the /bin and hence you wil have to call it as a normal perl script itself.
All that stuff will be done later.
```
perl pwatson.pl <arguments you would give to watson>
```

It might be buggy. And the code is nowehere neat but go ahead and check it out if you feel like it
